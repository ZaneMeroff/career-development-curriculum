# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects?<br>
**Answer:** I learned that agile is a specific style of workflow where a team designs, develops, tests, and then deploys smaller parts of the project so they can get quicker feedback on individual pieces of functionality. A well organized team should then perform a retro after each cycle to discuss what went well and what could be improved. In a waterfall workflow, a team only does each of the before mentioned steps once for the whole project, so the testing of the software comes at the very end of the project and only happens once. After the project is deployed, the team would perform a retro to debrief the team.

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?<br>
**Answer:** Our group chose to use the agile workflow method. We used a Trello project management board to digitally track each step of the project. After we completed one piece of functionality, we would test it out before pushing it to our master branch via GitHub.

3. What role did you take on in the project?<br>
**Answer:** Our team chose to work together for the majority of the project. We utilized a driver/navigator method as we created each piece of functionality. There were a few times where we would split up to build a function, then come back together to test it before pushing to our master branch.

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?<br>
**Answer:** I feel our attack method worked well for this project due to it's smaller size. For a larger application, we would be required to work independently on each piece of functionality before coming back together to test and deploy.

5. How does retro function in a team project?<br>
**Answer:** Retros are important because they provide the team an opportunity to look back on their work together to assess what went well and what could be improved next time. This is important because it enables a team to pinpoint their weaknesses and work to improve them so they are not repeated in the next project or piece of a project.

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?<br>
**Answer:** For our group project, our team spoke openly each day giving feedback to each other. We made a point to ensure our feedback described the specific situation, described the specific behavior, and described a specific impact. We also used the "compliment sandwich" method when speaking.

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?<br>
**Answer:** I feel I am a very honest person and don't have a problem expressing feedback and/or concerns regarding our team. This group project has given me more opportunities to provide feedback to my team on a daily basis. I think I could improve my feedback and communication skills by giving myself/team more opportunities to perform retros.
